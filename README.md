# Project Aim — Local Cloud DevOps Project

## Goal
To **learn, implement, and document** the end-to-end workflow of modern DevOps using:
- **Docker** — For containerizing applications.
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)** — For orchestrating containers locally.
- **Terraform** — For provisioning infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** — For automating build and deployment pipelines.

---

## Why This Project?
In a real-world DevOps environment, you often: 
1. **Build** an application into a container image.
2. **Deploy** it to a scalable environment (Kubernetes).
3. **Automate** deployments with CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Provision** infrastructure reproducibly (Terraform).

This project replicates that workflow **on my local machine** so I can:
- Practice each DevOps skill **step-by-step**.
- Create **reference notes** for interviews and revision.
- Troubleshoot real errors and document the fixes.

---

## What I Expect to Learn
- How to write **Dockerfiles** and run containers.
- How Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, Services) work together.
- How Minikube mimics a production cluster locally.
- How to set up automated build/deploy workflows in GitHub Actions.
- How to declare and manage infrastructure with Terraform.

---

## Deliverables in This Repo
- **Working Code**: A simple Python Flask app.
- **Docker Image**: Built locally for the app.
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Deployment + Service configs.
- **Concept Notes**: Minimal but interview-focused.
- **Future**: Terraform scripts + CI/CD workflows.
